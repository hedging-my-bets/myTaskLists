PetProgress turns the Lock Screen into your control panel: see the current hour\u2019s task, tap \u2713 / \u2715 / \u2039 / \u203a to complete, skip, or page tasks without opening the app, and watch a pet evolve or de-evolve as XP crosses thresholds. The experience uses interactive widgets powered by App Intents, plus hourly, timeline-driven updates so the widget stays fresh. State is shared between app and widget to keep everything in sync. \r\nApple Developer\r\n+2\r\nApple Developer\r\n+2\r\n\r\nAudience & value. For routine-driven people who dislike notification clutter, PetProgress keeps focus glanceable and actionable; the pet\u2019s visible progress adds emotion and streak pressure that nudges consistency.\r\nPlatform & scope. iPhone-only app with Lock-Screen widgets in inline, circular, and rectangular families, plus a lightweight app for settings and (optional) a simple \u201ctoday\u201d list. \r\nApple Developer\r\n+1\r\n\r\nCore experience. (1) Lock-Screen actions: four buttons\u2014Complete, Skip, Previous, Next\u2014execute App Intents directly from the widget, mutate shared state, and trigger a scoped timeline reload so the UI reflects changes promptly. (2) Nearest-hour window: the widget always shows the task closest to the current hour; a configurable Grace Minutes window lets a task remain \u201ccurrent\u201d briefly into the next hour. Updates come from an AppIntentTimelineProvider scheduled at hourly boundaries, with explicit reloads after actions. (3) Pet evolution & de-evolution: a stage image is chosen from XP thresholds; completing tasks adds XP; missed tasks at midnight + grace subtract XP, and the next render shows the new stage. (4) True sync: both targets use an App Group for small shared data so the app and widget always see the same truth. \r\nApple Developer\r\n+4\r\nApple Developer\r\n+4\r\nApple Developer\r\n+4\r\n\r\nWhat the user sees. Rectangular: left\u2014pet stage art; right\u2014current task title with a tiny hour badge; row of \u2039 \u2713 \u2715 \u203a. Circular: pet face/progress for quick glance. Inline: ultra-compact \u201cTask \u2022 hh:00 \u2022 Stage N\u201d. All are designed for Lock-Screen accessory families. \r\nApple Developer\r\n\r\nBehavioral rules. Rollover occurs at midnight + Grace Minutes: undone tasks become \u201cmissed,\u201d XP penalties apply, and the pet may de-evolve; the widget reflects this on its next timeline render. Actions request a reload of this widget kind; system-managed timelines ensure regular updates while conserving power. \r\nApple Developer\r\n+1\r\n\r\nData (conceptual). Small, local models shared through the App Group: Task {id, title, dueHour, dayKey, isDone}; PetState {xp, stageIndex}; Settings {graceMinutes, privacyPolicyURL}; WidgetViewState {currentIndex}. Stored as tiny JSON blobs and/or UserDefaults(suiteName:). \r\nApple Developer\r\n\r\nSettings & privacy. In-app Grace Minutes (0\u201330) with a short explainer and an in-app Privacy Policy link; fully offline\u2014no accounts or cloud in v1.\r\nSuccess (v1).

You want to create an iPhone-only app called \"PetProgress\" that helps users build habits through lock screen widgets featuring an evolving pet. The core experience revolves around completing or skipping tasks directly from the lock screen, with the pet's evolution reflecting the user's progress.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Lock Screen Widgets:** Implement inline, circular, and rectangular lock screen widgets that display the current task, pet stage, and action buttons (Complete, Skip, Previous, Next).\n*   **Task Management:** Create a basic task management system where users can add tasks with a title and due hour.\n*   **Pet Evolution:** Design a system where the pet evolves based on XP gained from completing tasks and de-evolves when tasks are missed.\n*   **Settings:** Implement a settings screen where users can configure grace minutes and access the privacy policy.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White)\n    *   Text: `#282828` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#707070` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#7B68EE` (Medium Purple)\n    *   Secondary: `#E6E6FA` (Lavender)\n    *   Accent: `#9370DB` (Medium Purple)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#D8BFD8` (Thistle)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is set up with React Native and Expo 54.\n2.  **Widget Implementation:** Create the three types of lock screen widgets (inline, circular, and rectangular) using Expo's widget API.\n3.  **Task Data Model:** Define the `Task` data model with properties like `id`, `title`, `dueHour`, `dayKey`, and `isDone`.\n4.  **Pet State Data Model:** Define the `PetState` data model with properties like `xp` and `stageIndex`.\n5.  **Settings Data Model:** Define the `Settings` data model with properties like `graceMinutes` and `privacyPolicyURL`.\n6.  **Data Storage:** Implement local storage using `AsyncStorage` to store the task list, pet state, and settings.\n7.  **App Intents:** Implement App Intents for the Complete, Skip, Previous, and Next actions.\n8.  **Timeline Updates:** Schedule hourly timeline updates using `AppIntentTimelineProvider`.\n9.  **Settings Screen:** Create a settings screen with options to configure grace minutes and access the privacy policy.\n10. **UI Design:** Implement the UI design with the specified colors and typography.\n11. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the app and widgets to ensure they function correctly and the data is synchronized.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, please remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-01T21:20:24.795719"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the PetProgress app!

While I cannot create native Swift/SwiftUI apps with interactive Lock Screen widgets in this environment, I've implemented a comprehensive in-app experience with all the core features.\n\n### \u2705 What's Included\n\n**Core Features:**\n- \ud83d\udccb **Task Management** - Hourly tasks from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM\n- \ud83d\udc23 **Pet Evolution** - 8 stages from Egg to Legendary Eagle\n- \u2713 **Complete/Skip Actions** - Mark tasks as done or skipped\n- \u25c0\ufe0f \u25b6\ufe0f **Task Navigation** - Browse through your daily tasks\n- \u270f\ufe0f **Editable Tasks** - Long press to customize task titles\n- \ud83c\udf19 **Midnight Rollover** - Automatic daily reset with XP penalties for missed tasks\n- \u23f0 **Grace Period** - Configurable 0-30 minute grace window\n- \ud83d\udcca **Progress Tracking** - Visual XP progress bars and statistics\n- \ud83c\udfa8 **Beautiful UI** - Purple/Lavender theme with smooth animations\n- \ud83c\udf13 **Dark Mode** - Full light/dark mode support\n\n**XP System:**\n- +5 XP per completed task\n- -3 XP per missed task (at midnight + grace period)\n- 0 XP for skipped tasks\n- Pet evolves/de-evolves based on XP thresholds\n\n**Pet Stages:**\n1. \ud83e\udd5a Egg (0 XP)\n2. \ud83d\udc23 Hatchling (10 XP)\n3. \ud83d\udc25 Baby (30 XP)\n4. \ud83d\udc24 Juvenile (60 XP)\n5. \ud83e\udd86 Teen (100 XP)\n6. \ud83e\udda2 Adult (150 XP)\n7. \ud83e\udd9a Elder (220 XP)\n8. \ud83e\udd85 Legendary (300 XP)\n\n### \ud83d\udcf1 App Structure\n\n**Screens:**\n- **Home** - Main task interface with pet display, current task card, and task list\n- **Settings** - Grace period configuration, pet stages reference, and how-to guide\n\n**Key Components:**\n- `PetDisplay` - Animated pet with stage name, XP, and progress bar\n- `TaskCard` - Interactive task card with complete/skip/prev/next buttons\n- `TaskList` - Overview of all daily tasks with status indicators\n\n**Data Management:**\n- Local storage with AsyncStorage\n- Automatic rollover detection\n- Persistent state across app restarts\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 How to Use\n\n1. **Complete Tasks** - Tap the green \u2713 button to complete the current task (+5 XP)\n2. **Skip Tasks** - Tap the orange \u2715 button if you can't complete a task (no penalty)\n3. **Navigate** - Use \u25c0\ufe0f \u25b6\ufe0f buttons to browse through tasks\n4. **Edit Tasks** - Long press any task title to customize it\n5. **Watch Your Pet Grow** - Complete tasks consistently to evolve your pet\n6. **Avoid Penalties** - Complete or skip tasks before midnight + grace period\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Settings\n\n- **Grace Minutes** - Adjust how long tasks remain \"current\" after their hour (0-30 minutes)\n- **Pet Stages** - View all evolution stages and their XP requirements\n- **How It Works** - Quick reference guide\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf What's Different from Native iOS\n\n**Not Possible in React Native:**\n- \u274c Interactive Lock Screen widgets (requires native WidgetKit + App Intents)\n- \u274c Lock Screen actions without opening the app\n- \u274c System-managed timeline updates\n- \u274c App Groups for widget/app data sharing\n\n**React Native Alternative:**\n- \u2705 Full in-app task management experience\n- \u2705 All core logic and features working\n- \u2705 Beautiful, smooth animations\n- \u2705 Offline-first with local storage\n- \u2705 Cross-platform (iOS, Android, Web)\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Future Enhancements\n\nIf you want to add more features:\n- Local notifications for task reminders\n- Weekly/monthly statistics\n- Multiple pets or pet customization\n- Task categories or tags\n- Streak tracking\n- Export/import data\n\n### \ud83c\udfa8 Design\n\nThe app uses a clean, modern design with:\n- Purple/Lavender/Thistle color palette\n- Smooth animations with Reanimated\n- Haptic feedback for interactions\n- Responsive layout for all screen sizes\n- Accessible contrast ratios\n\n---\n\n**Note:** For true interactive Lock Screen widgets, you would need to build a native iOS app using Xcode, Swift, WidgetKit, and App Intents. This React Native implementation provides the complete app experience but cannot access iOS Lock Screen widget APIs.\n\nEnjoy building your habits with PetProgress! \ud83d\udc23\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83e\udd85"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-11-01T21:29:36Z"}]
