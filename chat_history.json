PetProgress turns the Lock Screen into your control panel: see the current hour\u2019s task, tap \u2713 / \u2715 / \u2039 / \u203a to complete, skip, or page tasks without opening the app, and watch a pet evolve or de-evolve as XP crosses thresholds. The experience uses interactive widgets powered by App Intents, plus hourly, timeline-driven updates so the widget stays fresh. State is shared between app and widget to keep everything in sync. \r\nApple Developer\r\n+2\r\nApple Developer\r\n+2\r\n\r\nAudience & value. For routine-driven people who dislike notification clutter, PetProgress keeps focus glanceable and actionable; the pet\u2019s visible progress adds emotion and streak pressure that nudges consistency.\r\nPlatform & scope. iPhone-only app with Lock-Screen widgets in inline, circular, and rectangular families, plus a lightweight app for settings and (optional) a simple \u201ctoday\u201d list. \r\nApple Developer\r\n+1\r\n\r\nCore experience. (1) Lock-Screen actions: four buttons\u2014Complete, Skip, Previous, Next\u2014execute App Intents directly from the widget, mutate shared state, and trigger a scoped timeline reload so the UI reflects changes promptly. (2) Nearest-hour window: the widget always shows the task closest to the current hour; a configurable Grace Minutes window lets a task remain \u201ccurrent\u201d briefly into the next hour. Updates come from an AppIntentTimelineProvider scheduled at hourly boundaries, with explicit reloads after actions. (3) Pet evolution & de-evolution: a stage image is chosen from XP thresholds; completing tasks adds XP; missed tasks at midnight + grace subtract XP, and the next render shows the new stage. (4) True sync: both targets use an App Group for small shared data so the app and widget always see the same truth. \r\nApple Developer\r\n+4\r\nApple Developer\r\n+4\r\nApple Developer\r\n+4\r\n\r\nWhat the user sees. Rectangular: left\u2014pet stage art; right\u2014current task title with a tiny hour badge; row of \u2039 \u2713 \u2715 \u203a. Circular: pet face/progress for quick glance. Inline: ultra-compact \u201cTask \u2022 hh:00 \u2022 Stage N\u201d. All are designed for Lock-Screen accessory families. \r\nApple Developer\r\n\r\nBehavioral rules. Rollover occurs at midnight + Grace Minutes: undone tasks become \u201cmissed,\u201d XP penalties apply, and the pet may de-evolve; the widget reflects this on its next timeline render. Actions request a reload of this widget kind; system-managed timelines ensure regular updates while conserving power. \r\nApple Developer\r\n+1\r\n\r\nData (conceptual). Small, local models shared through the App Group: Task {id, title, dueHour, dayKey, isDone}; PetState {xp, stageIndex}; Settings {graceMinutes, privacyPolicyURL}; WidgetViewState {currentIndex}. Stored as tiny JSON blobs and/or UserDefaults(suiteName:). \r\nApple Developer\r\n\r\nSettings & privacy. In-app Grace Minutes (0\u201330) with a short explainer and an in-app Privacy Policy link; fully offline\u2014no accounts or cloud in v1.\r\nSuccess (v1).

You want to create an iPhone-only app called \"PetProgress\" that helps users build habits through lock screen widgets featuring an evolving pet. The core experience revolves around completing or skipping tasks directly from the lock screen, with the pet's evolution reflecting the user's progress.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Lock Screen Widgets:** Implement inline, circular, and rectangular lock screen widgets that display the current task, pet stage, and action buttons (Complete, Skip, Previous, Next).\n*   **Task Management:** Create a basic task management system where users can add tasks with a title and due hour.\n*   **Pet Evolution:** Design a system where the pet evolves based on XP gained from completing tasks and de-evolves when tasks are missed.\n*   **Settings:** Implement a settings screen where users can configure grace minutes and access the privacy policy.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White)\n    *   Text: `#282828` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#707070` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#7B68EE` (Medium Purple)\n    *   Secondary: `#E6E6FA` (Lavender)\n    *   Accent: `#9370DB` (Medium Purple)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#D8BFD8` (Thistle)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is set up with React Native and Expo 54.\n2.  **Widget Implementation:** Create the three types of lock screen widgets (inline, circular, and rectangular) using Expo's widget API.\n3.  **Task Data Model:** Define the `Task` data model with properties like `id`, `title`, `dueHour`, `dayKey`, and `isDone`.\n4.  **Pet State Data Model:** Define the `PetState` data model with properties like `xp` and `stageIndex`.\n5.  **Settings Data Model:** Define the `Settings` data model with properties like `graceMinutes` and `privacyPolicyURL`.\n6.  **Data Storage:** Implement local storage using `AsyncStorage` to store the task list, pet state, and settings.\n7.  **App Intents:** Implement App Intents for the Complete, Skip, Previous, and Next actions.\n8.  **Timeline Updates:** Schedule hourly timeline updates using `AppIntentTimelineProvider`.\n9.  **Settings Screen:** Create a settings screen with options to configure grace minutes and access the privacy policy.\n10. **UI Design:** Implement the UI design with the specified colors and typography.\n11. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the app and widgets to ensure they function correctly and the data is synchronized.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, please remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-01T21:20:24.795719"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the PetProgress app!

Now let me create a summary document explaining what was implemented:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the home screen widget infrastructure and deep linking system for PetProgress. Here's what was done:\n\n### \u2705 Implemented Features\n\n**1. 30-Stage Pet Progression**\n- Updated `constants/petStages.ts` with all 30 animals as specified (Egg \u2192 Chicken \u2192 Weasel \u2192 ... \u2192 Golden CEO)\n- Implemented XP thresholds: [0, 10, 25, 45, 70, 100, ..., 2320]\n- Default XP gain: +10 per task completion\n\n**2. Level-Scaled Penalty System**\n- Implemented `calculateMissPenalty(level)` formula: 1 + 2*(level\u22121)/29\n- Penalty scales from 1\u00d7 at Level 1 to 3\u00d7 at Level 30\n- Applied to both manual miss actions and rollover penalties\n\n**3. Deep Link System**\n- Created `navigation/deeplinks.ts` with handlers for:\n  - `petprogress://complete` - Complete current task\n  - `petprogress://skip` - Skip current task\n  - `petprogress://miss` - Mark as missed (with XP penalty)\n  - `petprogress://next` - Navigate to next task\n  - `petprogress://prev` - Navigate to previous task\n- Integrated deep link listener in `useAppState` hook\n- Updated `app.json` with proper URL scheme configuration\n\n**4. Widget State Store**\n- Created `shared/WidgetStateStore.ts` for shared state management\n- Exposes: todayTasks, currentIndex, petState, graceMinutes, lastRolloverAt\n- Syncs after every state change\n- Ready for native App Groups implementation\n\n**5. Timeline Utilities**\n- Created `utils/timeline.ts` with:\n  - `nextBoundaryConsideringGrace()` - Calculate next hourly refresh\n  - `getActiveHour()` - Get current active hour with grace\n  - `isWithinGracePeriod()` - Check if within grace window\n  - `getTimeUntilNextRefresh()` - Calculate refresh delay\n\n**6. Enhanced UI**\n- Updated `TaskCard` component with miss button (\u2715)\n- Added confirmation dialog for miss action\n- Updated home screen to use miss action\n- Enhanced settings screen with:\n  - Widget information section\n  - Deep links documentation\n  - Pet evolution details\n  - Grace minutes explanation\n\n**7. Rollover Logic**\n- Updated rollover to use level-scaled penalties\n- Properly integrates with grace minutes\n- Marks missed tasks and applies appropriate XP deduction\n\n**8. Documentation**\n- Created `docs/WIDGET_IMPLEMENTATION.md` with:\n  - Complete native iOS widget implementation guide\n  - Swift code examples\n  - Architecture overview\n  - QA exit criteria\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf How It Works\n\n**For Users:**\n1. Complete tasks to gain +10 XP and evolve your pet through 30 stages\n2. Miss tasks at rollover to lose XP (penalty scales with level)\n3. Use deep links from widgets or shortcuts to quickly complete/skip/navigate tasks\n4. Grace minutes setting allows tasks to remain \"current\" briefly into the next hour\n\n**For Developers:**\n1. All business logic is implemented in React Native\n2. Widget state is synced to shared storage after every change\n3. Deep links trigger state mutations and widget reloads\n4. Timeline utilities calculate hourly boundaries with grace periods\n5. Native iOS widgets can be built using the provided implementation guide\n\n### \ud83d\udcf1 Widget Specifications\n\n**Small Widget (systemSmall):**\n- Shows pet emoji + hour badge\n- Entire widget taps to `petprogress://complete`\n\n**Medium Widget (systemMedium):**\n- Left: Pet emoji\n- Right: Current task title (1-2 lines) + hour badge\n- Bottom: Five interactive buttons (\u2039 \u2713 \u2715 \u2192 \u203a)\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Important Notes\n\n1. **React Native Limitation**: Native iOS widgets with interactive buttons require a native build. The React Native implementation provides all the logic and deep link handlers, but the actual widget UI must be built natively in Swift/SwiftUI.\n\n2. **App Groups**: For native implementation, use App Groups with `UserDefaults(suiteName: \"group.com.petprogress.app\")` to share state between app and widget.\n\n3. **Widget Refresh**: Widgets should refresh hourly at boundaries calculated by `nextBoundaryConsideringGrace()`. After deep link actions, request widget reload.\n\n4. **Testing Deep Links**: You can test deep links by opening URLs like `petprogress://complete` in Safari or using the `xcrun simctl openurl` command.\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Steps\n\nTo fully implement native widgets:\n1.

Here's a plan to address the issues you're encountering with your PetProgress app:\n\n1.  **Add Calendar Tab:**\n    *   Modify the `FloatingTabBar.tsx` file to include a tab for the Calendar screen. This will involve adding a new entry to the `tabs` array with the appropriate route (`/calendar`) and icon.\n\n2.  **Task Descriptions:**\n    *   Ensure the `Task` interface in `types/index.ts` includes a `description` field.\n    *   Update the `TaskCard.tsx` component to display the task description.\n    *   Modify the calendar screen (`app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx`) to allow users to input and edit task descriptions when creating or modifying tasks.\n\n3.  **Task Card Movement:**\n    *   In `TaskCard.tsx`, after a user interacts with a task (completes, skips, or misses it), trigger a state update in the parent component (`HomeScreen` or wherever the task list is rendered).\n    *   This state update should re-render the task list, causing the cards to re-order based on the updated task status.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps with code examples:\n\n**1. Adding the Calendar Tab (FloatingTabBar.tsx):**\n\n```typescript\n// FloatingTabBar.tsx\ninterface TabBarItem {\n  route: string;\n  icon: string;\n  label: string;\n}\n\nconst tabs: TabBarItem[] = [\n  { route: '/(home)', icon: 'home', label: 'Home' },\n  { route: '/calendar', icon: 'calendar-month', label: 'Calendar' }, // ADD THIS LINE\n  { route: '/settings', icon: 'settings', label: 'Settings' },\n];\n```\n\n**2. Adding Task Descriptions (types/index.ts and TaskCard.tsx):**\n\n```typescript\n// types/index.ts\ninterface Task {\n  id: string;\n  title: string;\n  description: string; // ADD THIS LINE\n  dueHour: number;\n  isDone: boolean;\n  isSkipped: boolean;\n  isMissed: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n```typescript\n// TaskCard.tsx\ninterface TaskCardProps {\n  task: Task;\n  // ... other props\n}\n\nfunction TaskCard({ task, /* other props */ }) {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <Text>{task.title}</Text>\n      <Text>{task.description}</Text> {/* ADD THIS LINE */}\n      {/* ... other elements */}\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**3.

This will provide a smoother user experience.\n    *   Update the `useAppState` hook to trigger a re-render of the task list after the state is updated.\n\n2.  **Calendar Time and Day Input:**\n    *   In `app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx`, enhance the task creation form to include date and time pickers.\n    *   Use the `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` library to allow users to select a specific date and time for each task.\n    *   Modify the `handleAddTask` function to store the selected date and time in the task object.\n    *   Ensure that the task object includes fields for both date and time (e.g., `dueDate: Date`).\n    *   When displaying tasks, consider the `dueDate` field to determine which tasks are due on a particular day.\n\nThese changes will address the issues you're experiencing with task card behavior and calendar input.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T18:54:10.225233"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching for relevant code patterns to understand the current implementation, then make the necessary changes."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the relevant files to understand the current implementation:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "hooks/useAppState.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/TaskCard.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "utils/taskLogic.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "types/index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I understand the issues.

This likely involves changing the state of the task or the way the task list is filtered.\n\n3.  **Evolution/De-evolution Grading:**\n    *   Increase the difficulty of evolution and de-evolution by 75% per stage.\n    *   Modify the XP thresholds in `src/utils/petLogic.ts` or wherever the pet evolution logic is handled. The XP required for each stage should increase exponentially.\n\nI will focus on these changes to improve the user experience.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T19:44:29.411589"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix the color scheme, make skipped tasks clickable, and adjust the evolution difficulty.
